detection_notes: >
  Sigma cannot express aggregation thresholds reliably across all backends. 
  Implement a correlation search: count failed attempts by src_ip and target_user 
  over a 10-minute window and alert when (failed_attempts >= 5 for same user from >=3 distinct src_ip) 
  OR (failed_attempts >= 50 from single src_ip across many users). 
  Enrich with geolocation and device fingerprinting; consider temporary lockout and captcha triggers.
