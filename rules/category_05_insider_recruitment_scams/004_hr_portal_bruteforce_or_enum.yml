  - legitimate users with wrong password; mitigate by correlating src_ip and device fingerprint, and by setting thresholds (e.g., >10 failures from same IP across different accounts)

  Implement aggregation: count distinct target usernames failed from same src_ip within 10 minutes. If enumeration suspected (many 'user not found' across usernames), block source IP and escalate to SOC/HR. Use CAPTCHA / lockout policies to prevent abuse.
